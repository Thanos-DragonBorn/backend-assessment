# Backend Engineer Assessment

## Overview

Thank you for taking the time to complete this assessment. This challenge is designed to evaluate your ability to build backend services, work with databases, and implement algorithmic solutions. The entire assessment should take about **60 minutes**. Please choose one of the following paths for your backend service implementation:

- **General Backend Service:** (Choose your preferred language: Python, Java, or C#) – See the instructions in the `backend/` directory.
- **Java-Specific Backend Service:** If you are proficient in Java, follow the Spring Boot exercise in the `backend-java/` directory.

Additionally, please complete the algorithm challenge located in the `algorithm/` directory.
