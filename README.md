# Associate Backend Engineer Assessment

## Overview

Thank you for taking the time to complete this assessment. This challenge is designed to evaluate your ability to build a backend service, work with databases, and implement algorithmic solutions. The entire assessment should take about **60 minutes**. Please use one of the following programming languages for your solution: **Python**, **Java**, or **C#**. We’re looking for clean, well-organized code, effective error handling, and thoughtful use of data structures and algorithms.

## Assessment Structure

Your submission should be organized into at least two directories:

- **`backend/`** – Contains the backend service project.
- **`algorithm/`** – Contains the algorithm challenge solution.

---

## Part 1: Backend Service

### Objective
Implement a simple RESTful API to manage a resource of your choice (e.g., "Tasks", "Notes", or "Products").

### Requirements

1. **REST API Endpoints**
   - **GET `/items`**: Retrieve a list of items.
   - **GET `/items/{id}`**: Retrieve a specific item by its unique ID.
   - **POST `/items`**: Create a new item.
   - **PUT `/items/{id}`**: Update an existing item.
   - **DELETE `/items/{id}`**: Delete an item.

2. **Database Integration**
   - Connect your service to a database. You may use an in-memory solution (e.g., SQLite for Python, H2 for Java, or an equivalent for C#) or a lightweight file-based database.
   - Seed the database with a few initial records so that GET requests return sample data.

3. **Data Validation & Error Handling**
   - Validate incoming data and return appropriate HTTP status codes for invalid requests (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found).

4. **Language Choice**
   - Implement the service using **Python**, **Java**, or **C#**.

### Bonus (Optional)
- Write unit tests for your API endpoints.
- Implement pagination or filtering for the **GET `/items`** endpoint.
- Containerize your application using Docker.

## Part 2: Algorithm Challenge

### Problem Statement

Implement a function (or method) that accepts an array of integers and an integer `k`, and returns the `k` most frequent elements in the array.

**Example:**
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2 Output: [1,2]


### Requirements
- **Efficiency:** Optimize your solution for time and space complexity.
- **Testing:** Include test cases to demonstrate that your solution works as expected.
- **Integration:** You can write this function as part of your project or in a separate file/module within the **`algorithm/`** directory.

---

## Submission Guidelines

- **Repository Structure:** Ensure your solution is organized as described above.
- **README:** Update this README with instructions on how to build, run, and test your application.
- **Code Quality:** Write clean, well-documented code.
- **Time Management:** Aim to complete the challenge in approximately 60 minutes.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness:** Does the solution work as specified?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code clean, well-organized, and documented?
- **Database & API:** Are REST endpoints and database interactions implemented properly?
- **Algorithm Efficiency:** Is the algorithm solution efficient and correct?
- **Bonus:** Additional features (unit tests, Docker containerization, etc.) are a plus.

Good luck, and thank you for your time!
